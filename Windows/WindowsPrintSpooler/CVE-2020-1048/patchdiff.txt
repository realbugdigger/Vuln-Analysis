For finding out what was patched regarding this security vulnerability I downloaded following KB articles:
- KB4550964 (the vulnerable `localspl.dll` is located here)
- KB4556836 (the patched `localspl.dll` is located here)

After loading the two binaries in Ghidra Version tracker I performed automatic correlations and filtered out unmatched functions.
I found no functions were deleted but two were added: `IsValidNamedPipeOrCustomPort` and `IsPortNamedPipe`.

After performing additional correlator (PatchDiffCorrelator) I can see that the only function which doesnt have a perfect match was `LcmCreatePortEntry`.

In decompiled `LcmCreatePortEntry` we can see:
```
  bVar3 = IsValidNamedPipeOrCustomPort((LPCWSTR)param_2);
  if ((CONCAT31(extraout_var,bVar3) == 0) && (iVar8 = PortIsValid(param_2), iVar8 == 0)) {
```

We can see that `PortIsValid` and result from `IsValidNamedPipeOrCustomPort` are playing a role if following code will be executed.
